## About

Lend-it is an Android application designed to fascilitate the borrowing and lending of personal property items, something like an AirBnB for stuff. As my first Android project, it has a lot of room for optimization and improvement and has not been released. That said, I do not consider the project a failure as it proved a fruitful crash course in Android studio and mobile app development. 

The app makes extensive use of <a href="https://firebase.google.com/">Firebase</a> as well as the <a href="http://square.github.io/picasso/">Picasso</a> image library.
